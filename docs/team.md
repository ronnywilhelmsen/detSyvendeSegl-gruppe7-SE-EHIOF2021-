The ODP Project team is tasked with supporting the community on how to access and use FINOS infrastructure, providing feedback to the FINOS team as a way to improve tools, processes and automation; tasks are managed using a [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/8).

The ODP Project was approved by the FINOS Board on 21 June 2018.
